In the Main Branch => There are a total of 5 Branches that involve the Neural Network. 
FinalImputedDataFeatureSet1
FinalImputedDataFeatureSet2
FinalImputedDataFeatureSet3
FinalRegressionNotImputedFeatureSet3      --> Non Imputed Data with Feature Set 3 was created to check whether the imputed Data performs well. According to the Cross Validation it does
FinalClassificationModel                  --> This Classification Model was created to try and Improve the Score of the Model without Dew Point. This was Scraped since our model started doing well with the Imputed Data.
InitialDatacleaningFrameworkUsedInAllFiles   ---> The Inital Data Cleaning Base that Was used in most the files.
RandomForestDatSelection                    --->  This was a Feature Selection notebook created.
